  Censorship-resistance is an attribute that has become increasingly important in the digital age, as it refers to the difficulty that external parties, such as corporations or governments, have in preventing an individual from using a particular good.
  
  This attribute is particularly valuable for individuals living under regimes that enforce capital controls or prohibit certain forms of trade. Bitcoin is often cited as being a censorship-resistant good due to its decentralized, peer-to-peer network, which allows for transactions to be made without human intervention or permission.
  
  In contrast, the fiat banking system is regulated by states and requires human intervention to report and prevent certain uses of monetary goods, such as capital controls.
  
  Gold, although it is not issued by states, can be difficult to transmit at a distance and is therefore more subject to state regulation.
