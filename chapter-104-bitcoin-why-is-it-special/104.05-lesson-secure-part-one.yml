  The bitcoin network is worth well over $100 billion today. Accordingly, the network must be very secure — so that money is never stolen.
  
  
  Bitcoin is known as the world’s first cryptocurrency.
  
  
  The “crypto” part of the name comes from cryptography. Simply put, cryptography protects information through very complex math functions.
