# 602.2 Lesson - timePreference

**Screen:** timePreference
**Headline:** Time Preference
**Reward:** 20

**Text:** Time preference is the idea that the amount of time you have to wait for something to happen can affect the decisions you make.&amp;#x20;

For example, if you value the present more than the future, you might be more likely to choose something that gives you immediate gratification.&amp;#x20;

On the other hand, if you value the future more, you might be willing to wait longer for something that has a bigger benefit in the long term.&amp;#x20;

There are many factors that can influence your time preference, such as your personal safety, tax rates, property rights, and the ability to store value reliably.&amp;#x20;

The &quot;hardness&quot; of money (how well it holds its value over time) is also important because it can encourage people to save, plan, and invest for the future. It&#x27;s important to note that time preference is not a fixed thing - it can change based on the incentives in your environment.
