**Text:** Opportunity cost is the idea that when you choose to do one thing, you can&#x27;t do something else instead. In other words, every time you make a financial decision, you have to trade off one option for another.&amp;#x20;

Bitcoin can help you make better financial decisions in the long term because it&#x27;s a good way to store value (like saving money). This means that if you choose to invest in bitcoin, you might have to give up using that money for other things or opportunities. But if you hold onto your bitcoin, it has the potential to increase in value over time.&amp;#x20;

This is especially important right now because the traditional monetary system (called &quot;fiat&quot;) is not a reliable way to save money - it&#x27;s designed in a way that causes the value of money to go down over time. So, it&#x27;s important to make careful financial decisions to preserve your wealth.
