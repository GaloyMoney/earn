  Bitcoin is currently changing from the first stage of being used as money to the second stage. It may take several years for Bitcoin to be used as a way to trade goods and services, like other currencies.
  
  The process of Bitcoin becoming more widely accepted as money is uncertain, as the same process took a long time for gold and no one alive has seen a good become money in the same way that is happening with Bitcoin. There is not a lot of experience with this process, but developments around the world are very promising and happening faster in the interconnected digital age.
