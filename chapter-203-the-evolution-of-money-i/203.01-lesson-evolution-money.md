**Text:** In modern times, many people in the field of monetary economics focus on the idea that money is mainly used as a way to exchange goods and services.

In the past century, however, governments have had the exclusive power to create money and have often made it difficult for money to hold its value. This lead people to believe that the main purpose of money is to be used for exchange.

Some have argued that Bitcoin is not a good form of money because its value tends to change too much to be used effectively in transactions.

However, this way of thinking is backwards. Throughout history, the use of money has developed in stages, with its value as a store of value coming before its use as a medium of exchange.
