**Screen:** partlyMonetized

**Headline:** Partial Monetization

**Reward:** 9

**Text:** Goods that are not widely accepted as a unit of account may be considered &quot;partly monetized&quot; because they are used for some purposes related to money, but not all.

Gold is an example of a partly monetized good that is used to store value but is not widely used as a medium of exchange or unit of account. In some countries, different goods may be used for different purposes related to money, such as one good being used as a medium of exchange and another being used as a store of value or unit of account.

The dollar is an example of a good that is widely used for all three purposes of money in the United States, while the peso was an example of a good that was used as a medium of exchange in Argentina but was not a good store of value because of its volatility and regular loss of purchasing power.
