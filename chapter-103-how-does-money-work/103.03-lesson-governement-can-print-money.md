**Text:** Well, everybody should care!\


The practice of government printing money -- or increasing the supply of dollars -- leads to inflation.\


Inflation is an increase in the price of goods and services. In other words, the price for something in the future will be more expensive than today.\


So what does inflation mean for citizens?\


In the United Kingdom, the Pound Sterling has lost 99.5% of its value since being introduced over 300 years ago.\


In the United States, the dollar has lost 97% of its value since the end of WWI, about 100 years ago.\


This means a steak that cost $0.30 in 1920... was $3 in 1990… and about $15 today, in the year 2020!
