  All national currencies in circulation today are called “fiat” money. This includes US Dollars, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, and so forth.\
  
  
  The word “fiat” is latin for “by decree” -- which means “by official order”.\
  
  
  This means that all fiat money -- including the US Dollar -- is simply created by the order of the national government.
