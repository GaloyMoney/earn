# 502.6 Lesson - governmentBan

**Screen:** governmentBan
**Headline:** Governments Will Ban Bitcoin
**Reward:** 17

**Text:** It is technically possible for governments to ban bitcoin, but enforcing such a ban would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the bitcoin network.

Bitcoin relies on private keys, which are simply random numbers, to control access to transactions recorded on the blockchain. These private keys can be generated and stored anywhere, making them largely undectectable.

Additionally, the infrastructure required to access the bitcoin network is relatively simple and widely available, making it easy for people to trustlessly verify transactions.

As Saifedean Ammous said, &quot;Banning bitcoin is not much different from trying to ban math. It will just prove its utility &amp; drive more people to it.&quot;
