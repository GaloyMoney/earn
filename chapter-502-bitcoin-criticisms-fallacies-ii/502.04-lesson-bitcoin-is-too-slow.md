**Headline:** Bitcoin is too slow

**Reward:** 17

**Text:** Paying with bitcoin is not the same as using a credit card to make a purchase. When you use a credit card, your payment goes through multiple parties before reaching the merchant&#x27;s bank account after days or even weeks of processing.

In contrast, when you pay with bitcoin on the main blockchain, you are sending actual money directly to the recipient without any intermediaries. This means there is no risk of censorship and the transaction is considered final once it has been confirmed by six blocks on the blockchain.

The proper comparison would be between bitcoin base layer and the Fed as currency issuer and as a clearing mechanism.

Since the advent of the Lightning Network, the &quot;Bitcoin is too slow&quot; criticism has largely fallen silent.
