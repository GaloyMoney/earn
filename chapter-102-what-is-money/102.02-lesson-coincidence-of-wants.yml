title: Money solves the “coincidence of wants”... What is that??
reward: 4
text: |
  Centuries ago, before people had money, they would barter -- or haggle over how to trade one unique item, in exchange for another item or service. Let’s say you wanted to have a meal at the local restaurant, and offered the owner a broom. The owner might say “no” -- but I will accept three hats instead, if you happen to have them. You can imagine how difficult and inefficient a “barter economy” would be! By contrast, with money, you can simply present a $20 bill. And you know that the restaurant owner will readily accept it.
