  So what characteristics make for “good” money?
  Scarce: not abundant, nor easy to reproduce or copy
  Accepted: relatively easy for people to verify its authenticity
  Durable: easy to maintain, and does not perish or fall apart
  Uniform: readily interchangeable with another item of the same form
  Portable: easy to transport
  Divisible: can be split and shared in smaller pieces
