**Reward:** 10

**Text:** The Stock to Flow ratio is a measure of the rate at which new units of money are added to the existing supply.&amp;#x20;

To calculate it, you divide the existing amount of money by the amount produced each year.&amp;#x20;

For something to be a good way to save value, it should become more valuable when people want to use it to save, but the people who make it should not be able to add too much of it, which would make it less valuable.
