**Headline:** The primary function of money
**Reward:** 10

**Text:** Primitive money existed long before large scale trade networks. Archeologists found that early humans used valuable tools like arrowheads, collectibles like cowry shells and commodities like barley as primitive money.

The main advantage and primary function of these primitive moneys was to improve the workings of even small barter networks. Primitive moneys achieved this by eliminating the need to match coincidences of wants, interests, supply or skill. They also greatly reduced the need for credit, which, in the absence of writing in prehistoric times, was difficult to keep track of.
