**Text:** The earliest human societies engaged in trade through barter, but this method had several limitations. One issue was the &quot;double coincidence of wants&quot; problem, where two people needed to desire the same item at the same time in order to complete a trade.

To overcome this issue, humans began to collect and value certain items for their rarity and symbolic significance, such as shells, animal teeth, and flint.

These collectibles served as a way for early humans to store and transfer wealth, providing an evolutionary advantage over other species such as Homo neanderthalensis.
