  To solve the earlier mentioned issues of centralization and possible double spends, Satoshi invented a solution based on a decentralized network of nodes.&#x20;
  
  Nodes are computers that are in constant contact with each other. This by itself is nothing new. The internet itself has a similar infrastructure of interconnected nodes.&#x20;
  
  All bitcoin nodes, however, store a copy of the ledger of all transactions in the history of the Bitcoin network.&#x20;
  
  This new, decentralized form of bookkeeping, called blockchain, was first successfully implemented in Bitcoin and is extremely resistant to tampering.

question: Which technology did Satoshi implement to solve issues of centralization and double spends
answers:
- answer: The blockchain
  correct: true
  feedback: Correct! Satoshi was the first to successfully implement the blockchain - a concept first described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. It's a decentralized form of bookkeeping that is resistant to tampering and allows users to make and verify transactions without the need for a central authority
- answer: The internet
  correct: false
  feedback: No. The internet is a global network of interconnected computers, but it was not invented by Satoshi and does not solve issues of centralization and double spends. Try again
- answer: A decentralized network of nodes
  correct: false
  feedback: A decentralized network of nodes is an important part of Bitcoin, but it does not solve issues of centralization and double spends by itself. Try again!
