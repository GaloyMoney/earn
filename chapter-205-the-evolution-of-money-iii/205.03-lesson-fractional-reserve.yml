  Fractional Reserve Banking is a system in which banks are allowed to hold only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves, while using the rest to make loans.&#x20;
  
  One reason this system developed is because people wanted to earn money from their gold, rather than paying to store it.&#x20;
  
  They could do this by allowing a bank or vault to lend out their gold and receiving interest payment in return.&#x20;
  
  If more people deposited their gold than wanted to take it back, the bank could make more profit by using the same gold as collateral for multiple loans, hence keeping only a fraction of loans in reserve.
