# 503.6 Lesson - canBeDuplicated

**Screen:** canBeDuplicated
**Headline:** Bitcoin is not scarce because there are thousands of cryptocurrencies
**Reward:** 18

**Text:** One argument against the value of bitcoin is that it is not scarce because there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies available and because anyone can copy the code and create their own version.

However, this overlooks the fact that bitcoin is more than just a piece of code. It is an open source protocol for transferring value that attracts people and resources due to its transparency and rigorous development process.

As @BTCSchellingPt noted, &quot;open source is very much a meritocracy. You&#x27;ve got the hive mind building solutions. You get all that scrutiny and that comes back to security. Bitcoin Core is probably one of the most heavily scrutinized code bases in the world.&quot;&amp;#x20;

In other words, the value of bitcoin lies not only in its code, but also in the community and infrastructure that surrounds it.
