  If the value of money is not based on its scarcity, it may not be as reliable as a way to store wealth. In this case, other things that are scarce, such as assets or resources, may become more valuable and be used as a substitute for money.&#x20;
  
  This additional value is known as a monetary premium. When the usual form of money is not working well, people may turn to other things that are rare or hard to obtain as a way to exchange value.&#x20;
  
  Some historical forms of money had no other use or value besides being used as a way to trade for other things. The difference between the value of something as money and its value for its other uses is the monetary premium.
