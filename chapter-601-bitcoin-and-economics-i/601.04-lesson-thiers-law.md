**Headline:** Thier&#x27;s Law

**Reward:** 19

**Text:** Thier&#x27;s Law is a concept that discusses what might happen if people and businesses refused to accept or use a lower quality form of currency.&amp;#x20;

Instead of disappearing from circulation, the higher quality form of money might be traded at a premium, or for a higher value than its face value.&amp;#x20;

Thier&#x27;s Law suggests that if a government tries to force people to use a lower quality currency by making it legal tender, it will be ignored.&amp;#x20;

In other words, people and businesses may choose not to accept the lower quality currency and instead prefer to use the higher quality one or other forms of payment.
