**Text:** Excessive money printing and credit expansion can cause numerous social and economic issues, including asset bubbles in stocks and real estate markets which tend to experience corrections roughly every decade.&amp;#x20;

While those closest to the source of new money often benefit greatly from these cycles, lower income individuals who don&#x27;t own valuable assets and rely on regular paychecks are often the most affected by inflation and economic booms and busts created by the fiat currency system.&amp;#x20;

A well-known example of this is the Global Financial Crisis that began in 2008, which was preceded by a significant accumulation of debt and risk in the commercial banking sector.
