  Satoshi's solution to the double spending problem was a breakthrough in computer science and distributed systems. Until Bitcoin, many believed that it would be unsolvable.
  
  His solution allowed Satoshi to develop a new electronic cash system that for the first time made it possible for people to send digital money directly to each other, without needing a bank or other organization to help.

question: Which problem did Satoshi have to solve to create Bitcoin
answers:
- answer: The double spending problem
  correct: true
  feedback: Good job. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism where transactions are batched into blocks and chained together to a blockchain. This way, every user knows that every coin is only spent once
- answer: The problem of double coincidence of wants
  correct: false
  feedback: Not quite. The double coincidence of wants is a problem of barter that can be solved with money. Try again
- answer: The halving problem
  correct: false
  feedback: Hah no. The halving in bitcoin is not a problem, but part of the solution that Satoshi designed! More on that in Chapter 302. Try again!
